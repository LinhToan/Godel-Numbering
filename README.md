# Godel-Numbering

This is my code for the Godel numbering process in Javascript, using the prime number generator (python) in another of my repository. A Godel number is a number that's a product of raising prime numbers to another number, and the exponent number is an encoding of a letter. Thus the process is to convert each character in a string to a number (in this case, a decimal ASCII number), then raise prime numbers to the power of the decimal ASCII number. This results in extremely large numbers, so I should create a dictionary of letter to number at some point.
